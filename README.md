# faceMash

a facemash app I made using the data I collected from library.thapar.edu in [this project.](https://github.com/SU1199/nalanda)  
uses a modified version of [elo rating algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#:~:text=The%20Elo%20rating%20system%20is,a%20Hungarian-American%20physics%20professor.) to rate pictures of two people angainst each other.  
uses go's templating engine to render html and postgres as a data store.

inspired by David Fincher's [fictional work.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network)
